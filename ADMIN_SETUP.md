## Admin Authentication

The admin system checks for admin status by looking for a document in the `admins` collection in Firestore with the user's UID as the document ID.

## Security Notes

- Only users with documents in the `admins` collection can access admin features
- Admin actions require Firebase Admin SDK to be properly configured
- All admin actions are logged and can be tracked

## Troubleshooting

If you can't access admin features:
1. Check that your user UID exists in the `admins` collection
2. Verify Firebase Admin SDK is configured (check console for errors)
3. Make sure you're logged in with the correct account
4. Check browser console for any authentication errors
